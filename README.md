Students will learn Java application development using packages, classes, abstract, interface, inner classes, file
i/o, graphical user interface, database connectivity, and many more.

COURSE OBJECTIVES
At the end of this course, the successful student will be able to:
• Identify the purpose and behavior of a provided code fragment.
• Modify an existing code fragment to change its behavior.
• Modify conditional and iterative structures in a short program.
• Write well-structured, well-documented, well-commented readable code.
• Design, implement, test, and debug a program that uses each of the following fundamental programming
constructs: basic computation, simple I/O, basic conditional and iterative structures, and functions.
• Describe the syntax and semantics of conditional structures.
• Use conditional structures.
• Apply the techniques of decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces.
• Describe the role of formal and actual parameters of a function.
• Describe how strings and arrays are allocated, manipulated and used.
• Compare iterative and recursive solutions for elementary problems such as factorial.
• Formulate loop invariants for simple loops.
• Demonstrate loop termination.
• Implement, test, and debug simple recursive methods.
• Explain the philosophy of object- oriented design and the concepts of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance,
interface and polymorphism.
• Describe how the class mechanism supports encapsulation and information hiding.
• Compare and contrast the notions of overloading and overriding.
• Identify the scope of the variables involved in a given code.
Access and program databases using various classes.
• Design GUI programs.
• Implement version control.
• Construct class diagram, aggregation, and collaboration.
• Describe the significance and benefits of version control.
• Learn basic version control, assess the role of Git and create online repositories using Git.
• Describe the basic Junit framework, Design effective unit test cases for Java lasses in Junit Execution
Environment.
• Design class diagrams which describe the structure of a system by modeling its classes, attributes, methods
and relationships among objects.
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION:
Lecture, seminar, tutorial and hands-on exercises in the lab (Group work may be involved)
MEANS OF ASSESSMENT:
A final course grade will be determined based on the following instruments and their corresponding weighted
percentages:
Quizzes/Tests (2) 15% (7.5% each)
Assignments (2) 20% (10% each)
Midterm Exam 30%
Final Exam 35%
TOTAL 100%
Notes:
• In order to pass the course, students must, in addition to receiving an overall course grade of 50%, also
achieve a grade of at least 50% on the combined weighted examination components (including quizzes,
tests, and exams).
• If you miss more than 30% of the scheduled classes, you will receive UN Grade for your course grade.
• MIDTERM AND FINAL EXAMS ARE MANDATORY. A student who will miss the Midterm or
Final exam will receive a UN grade as the final grade.
GRADING POLICY:
Grade Numerical
Value Achievement Level Grade Numerical
Value Achievement Level
A+ 4.33 90% to 100%
UN 0.00`
Students completed less
than 70% of the total
evaluation of the course or
missed more than 30% of
the class where the
instructor’s Course Outline
specifies that attendance is
a course requirement.
A 4.00 85% to 89%
A- 3.67 80% to 84%
B+ 3.33 77% to 79%
B 3.00 73% to 76%
B- 2.67 70% to 72%
